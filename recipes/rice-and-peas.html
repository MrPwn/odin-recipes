        <h3> Description</h3>
        <p>
            Jamaican rice and peas—seasoned with the special trinity of thyme, scallion, and
             garlic—is a staple dish of the island. Like clockwork, my mom cooked Jamaican 
             rice and peas with a baked chicken every Sunday. Its woodsy flavor is 
             heightened by the addition of whole pimento seeds (aka allspice berries) and 
             its subtle heat comes from the Scotch bonnet pepper. We always had Scotch 
             bonnet peppers in the refrigerator and my mom would cut slivers from them to 
             add to almost everything. When used whole, the pepper lends a slightly fruity 
             flavor without the intense heat because the seeds and flesh are not exposed. 
             The very hot Scotch bonnet pepper can be found in farmers' markets or 
             Caribbean grocery stores, but a habanero pepper is a good substitute. I like 
             to use dried dark red kidney beans. They are often featured in this dish, but 
             you can also use green pigeon peas (aka gungo peas), which are also commonly 
             used. The coconut milk is infused with the reddish tint of the beans, which 
             gives the rice its signature blush.

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        
        <em>These amounts yield 6 to 8 servings</em>
        
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup dried kidney beans - rinsed, soaked overnight and drained</li>
            <li>3 cups water</li>
            <li>1 small onion, finely chopped</li>
            <li>2 scallions, finely chopped</li>
            <li>3 garlic cloves, minced</li>
            <li>5 allspice berries</li>
            <li>5 thyme sprigs</li>
            <li>1 scotch bonnet pepper</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon grated fresh ginger</li>
            <li>Kosher salt</li>
            <li>black pepper</li>
            <li>one 13.5 ounce can unsweetened coconut milk</li>
            <li>2 cups long-grain white rice</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Steps</h3>

        <ol>
            <li>In a large saucepan, cover the beans with the water and bring to a boil 
                over moderately high heat. Stir in the onion, scallions, garlic, allspice, 
                thyme, Scotch bonnet, ginger, 2 teaspoons salt and 1/2 teaspoon pepper. 
                Stir in the coconut milk and bring to a simmer. Cover and simmer over low 
                heat until beans are tender, about 1 hour; adjust the heat as necessary to 
                maintain a gentle simmer.
            </li>
            <li>Stir in the rice, cover and simmer over low heat until the rice is tender 
                and the liquid is absorbed, about 30 minutes. Remove from the heat and let 
                steam for 10 minutes, then discard the thyme stems, allspice berries and 
                Scotch bonnet. Using a fork, fluff the rice and beans and season with salt. 
                Serve hot.</li>
